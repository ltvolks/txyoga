You define a collection and some elements for that collection. txyoga gives
you a resource, which Twisted then lets you serve to clients.

Where did the name from?
========================

The ``tx`` is a common prefix for Twisted community code. It's called yoga
because it's Twisted REST. Get it? Yes, I'm terrible.
